Notes

The set of used punctuation is .!?.
Punctuation should be kept in your return string, but spaces should not.
Xray should not have a dash within.
Every word and punctuation mark should be seperated by a space ' '.
There should be no trailing whitespace
Although the proper alphabet for j is Juliett you have to use Juliet here
